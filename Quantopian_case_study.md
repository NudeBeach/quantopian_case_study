# Quantopian Case Study 
![logo](https://analyzingalpha.com/assets/images/posts/2019-09-30-quantopian-logo.png)
## Introduction
Since the advent of the internet the "do it yourself" mentality has been growing stronger and stronger. People are constantly researching methodology and are relying less and less on services. People are becoming empowered. They want to make decisions on their own time. Society wants instant gratification. In the past, one would have to go to the library to do research, but now one can Google. One used to call a specialist for specific repairs and now one will immediately search for a "how to" on YouTube. While these inclinations are still pretty generational, they illustrate what the future holds. This mindset is trickling down into every aspect of our lives be it a gift or a curse. One of the most recent buzz worthy industries affected by this mindset is Finance.

Financial Technology or FinTech is one of the most buzzing terms right now. Startups all over are shaking up the financial industry by offering visually pleasing, streamlined services right from your phone. But, let’s not also think that financial technology is new. The term dates back to around 1985 - 1990. We must also remember that the ATM was introduced in 1967 by Barclay's bank and that Cobol (Common Business Oriented Language) was one of the first programming languages and dates back to 1959. FinTech could be broken into era's and the present would be the era of the internet and the cellphone. 

People are using the internet for limitless knowledge, social networking, and entertainment. Industries are losing their air of mystique from the internets transparency. One of the biggest industries being affected is investment banking. Apps like Robinhood allow anyone with a cellphone to begin trading. Who needs a financial advisor anymore? But, this can also come with its downfalls when not regulated properly. While resources are vastly available everyone may not do their due diligence to understand what is happening or still just not completely grasp what is going on in front of them. This could then turn into something like a game or just gambling and create massive debt for example. There has been a recent suicide because a man did not understand or handle his options trading properly with said app. He saw -$730,000 and felt that his life was ruined. This is a very sad example, but it expresses the cruel realities of too much power in the hands of those who are not completely informed. Again the internet is a source of knowledge. A financial company that can combine the social and entertainment aspects of the internet with its educational aspects will make a solid offering into the “do it yourself” day trader boom and the FinTech market as a whole. Quantopian is an attempt at that offering. 


## The Facts 
### What is Quantopian?

* Quantopian was founded in Boston, MA in 2011 by the CEO John Fawcett and CTO Jean Bredeche. 

*  The Quantopian project came about because of John Fawcett's desire to make finance more open. The Quantopian website specifically states,
> Quantopian is a flexible, powerful, and performant data science platform for quantitative finance. Our enterprise product, Quantopian Enterprise, is designed for quantitative finance professionals who want to use Python to build and evaluate equity factors on a modern cloud-based platform. 
Our free community product is used by scientists, developers, and students to learn and to exchange ideas about quantitative finance. With members from more than 200 countries, this community provides a free and welcoming learning environment for people all over the world. ([About Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/about))


* Quantopian is based on the power of diversification. In finance everyone knows the power of a diversified portfolio. Quantopian believes in taking this idea one step higher in the pipeline and using diverse investment strategies to find the "holy grail" of investing, uncorrelated return streams. Quantopian is bringing together a community of people with very different backgrounds, giving them diverse markets and diverse data, and diversifying in every possible way. This all comes together to create completely diversified strategies. John Fawcett believes that statistically the "holy grail" is only a search of strategies and that by crowd-sourcing this task/opportunity Quantopian will be able to find numerous independent uncorrelated return streams. This would completely topple the current hedge fund model. They do this by discovering, equipping, and rewarding independent Quants. ([Introduction to Quantopian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZtg3kJzHEU))

* Quantopian is a free offering but is funded and advised by:   
  - Andreessen Horowitz
  - Bessemer Venture Partners
  - Khosla Ventures
  - Spark Capital
  - Point72 Ventures
  - GETCO
  - Anthemis Group
  - FinTech Sandbox
  - Wicklow Capital
 
  With the above assistance they were able to accumulate a total of $49.5 Million in funding and received Series C funding in 2016. ([CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quantopian#section-investors))([Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/quantopian.com))
  
  ***Note:*** *In 2016 Steve Cohen put 250 Million into the firm to be under the direction of algorithms managed by Quantopian and in addition make an investment in Quantopian itself. In February of this year, 2020, Fawcett announced that investment money would be returned due to under performance.* ([Steve Cohen](https://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-cohen-quantopian/steve-cohen-bets-250-million-on-firm-that-uses-algorithms-idUSKCN1071XI))([Under Performance](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/02/20/fintech-firm-quantopian-is-returning-investors.html))
  
* One important last thing about the company is that it creates the sense of competition and game-play by actually offering daily and monthly competitions. Successful algorithms are then invested in by Quantopian with a cash prize and may also be invested in by third party banks/funds. ([Quantopian Contest](https://pando.com/2015/03/05/finance-novice-beats-hedge-fund-pros-wins-100k-in-inqugural-quantopian-trading-contest/))  

#### Key Takeaways
* **Founded**: Boston, MA in 2011.
* **Founders**: CEO John Fawcett, CTO Jean Bredeche.
* **Mission**: Find uncorrelated return streams by crowd-sourcing for investment strategies.
* **Funding**: $49.5 Million from multiple investors, Series C funding in 2016. (See note as well)



### Business Activities:

* Quantopian is basically another company working to break down the barriers of Wall Street. They are not specifically fixing a problem in Finance per se, but they are again taking advantage of the "D-I-Y Boom". I would say if one had to state a problem, Quantopian could be a solution to the current under performance of hedge funds. ([The Exodus of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/the-great-exodus-out-of-hedge-funds-4774662)) But in reality their goal feels to be to create the new-age hedge fund by basically using the free work of others. They also allow for anyone to now become a Quant and work based off of raw skill and data, not an Ivy League institution on your resume. ([Quantopian CEO on Trading & Big Data](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/08/25/quantopian-ceo-on-trading-big-data.html)).

* The Quantopian customer is virtually anyone, a Quant that wants to learn more, a seasoned hedge fund worker who would like to learn algorithmic trading, a bartender that found out about Algorithmic Trading. Quantopian will teach anyone and gives anyone and everyone the platform. That is the big push behind their idea on diversification. This makes this platform basically open for greatness. Their sheer man power of ideas attacks the modern hedge fund competitor, 
>The basis of competition within the hedge fund industry is shifting. Firms are competing to attract professionals with completely different skill-sets and heavily investing in technology as they try to maximize returns via sophisticated trading algorithms.
Quantopian is trying a different approach. Instead of embarking on an expensive and time-consuming recruitment process, they have created an online crowd-sourcing platform anyone can use to develop and test trading algorithms.([Quantopian the Democratization of Wall Street?](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/quantopian-the-democratization-of-wall-street/))

In the space of online algorithmic trading. Competitors like QuantConnect charge to trade. Again Quantopian is a free offering. They are all pretty much the same but Quantopian has a large and active community, and focuses on the U.S. and Equities. Other competitors like Numerai are just so relatively small that they do not draw as much of a crowd of developers. What also really stands out about Quantopian is the learning aspect. Quantopian is not only trying to get users so it can make its pool bigger, it is also trying to educate those users so its pool can be better. The most important aspect about this idea is being able to have a big draw and bring over the best and brightest. 

* One thing that is an advantage as well is that they have a relationship with FactSet, an award winning data provider. This would give Quantopian users the advantage to create more reliable alogrithms. ([Quantopian Enterprise](https://factset.quantopian.com))([FactSet](https://www.factset.com/about-our-company?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Mb3BRCaARIsAPSNGpWW4Nk9SrLQY1bSiwemoETaP4oS_Jn7oY0WwWaTo1XUu0zlxa5czzwaAvhZEALw_wcB)). Quantopian uses Python as their language of choice. Python is a top languge known for its ease of use which will make it easier for Quantopian to bring in those new Quants from these vast backgrounds. Python is also on the rise to being the top language used in programming. ([Python on the Rise](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3401536/python-popularity-reaches-an-all-time-high.html)). They also have specific Open Source programs they created:
  - **Zipline**: A Pythonic algorithmic trading library used by Quantopian to run backtests.
  - **Alphalens**: A Python library for performance analysis of predictive (alpha) stock factors. Alphalens works well with Zipline and Pyfolio.
  - **Pyfolio**: A Python library for performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios. It produces a tearsheet with various plots that provide a comprehensive image of a trading algorithm's performance.
  - **Qgrid**: A Jupyter notebook widget which uses SlickGrid to render pandas DataFrames within a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to explore your DataFrames with intuitive scrolling, sorting, and filtering controls, as well as edit your DataFrames by double clicking cells.
  - **Trading Calendars**: A Python library of exchange calendars meant to be used with Zipline.
  - **Empyrical**: A Python library that calculates common financial risk metrics.
  - **PenguinDome**: A simple Linux mobile device management system.
  - **PGContents**: A Postgres-backed ContentsManager implementations for Jupyter.
  - **qdb**: A debugger for Python that lets users debug code executing on remote machines.
  - **Serializable Traitlets**: A Python 2/3 compatible library providing a restricted subset of the classes from IPython Traitlets.
  - **Coal Mine**: A periodic task execution monitor.
  - **Warp Prism**: A tool to quickly move date from postgres to numpy or pandas.

  ([Quantopian Open Source](https://www.quantopian.com/opensource))

#### Key Takeaways
- Quantopian seeks to shake-up the model of the traditional hedge fund and be **the answer to the "Hedge fund exodus"**.
- Quantopian intends to do this by creating **a crowd sourced hedge fund that anyone can be a part of**, while at the same time educating those involved. 
- Quantopian's **focus on education**, ease of use, and their relationship with FactSet put them at an advantage to their competitors.
- Quantopian is **Python based** and also has many open source softwares they have created. 


### Landscape:

* Crowdsourced algorithmic trading programs like Quantopian are disrupting the hedge fund industry. The creator of Quantiacs, a competitor of Quantopian, actually stated that if this idea is successful, there will be no need for hedge funds anymore. ([The Rise of the DIY Algo Trader](https://www.ft.com/content/0a706330-5f28-11e6-ae3f-77baadeb1c93))

* The classic hedge fund model has seen much strain throughout the years. As of late, many investors have been pulling billions of dollars from hedge funds because of poor performance. This leaves the domain open for change. Tony James, president of Blackstone, has predicted “a day of reckoning” that will contract the hedge fund industry by as much as a quarter. ([Hedge Fund Trouble](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/hedge-funds-may-lose-quarter-of-assets-blackstone-s-james-says))

* There are numerous competitors in this domain, but the most noteable are: 
  - Quantiacs
  - QuantConnect
  - Numerai

#### Key Takeaways
* The **hedge fund domain is open for change** due to lack of performance by traditional hedge funds.
* **Quantopian has numerous competitors**: Quantiacs, Quantconnect, and Numerai to name a few. 

### Results
Quantopian has a two-sided market business model:

The first side consists of algorithm-developer members who develop and test for free, creating algorithms that can be added to Quantopian's offerings to institutional investors. Again remember the goal is to create a "holy grail" system for an institutional investor. Quantopian wants to become THE hedge fund of the future.

All members can compete against other members in a series of contests called the "Quantopian Open." This is how Quantopian finds its algorithms. Anyone can join the site and enter the contests if they like. ([Quantopian Open)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/grant-kiehne-finance-industry-outsider-awarded-100000-to-manage-by-quantopian-300045002.html)

The second side is institutional investors. Serving them will become the main focus of Quantopian. These members have their investments managed by the winning algorithms. Successful developer-members can get a royalty or commission from investor-members, who profit from the former's algorithm used with larger resources > $1M. ([Run a Hedge Fund From Your Home](https://video.seas.harvard.edu/media/IACS+Seminar+Quantopian+2015-02-20/1_et37gyqb))

The business model capitalizes on the entire "D-I-Y" movement and is genius. You are making others work for you. John Fawcett can find his "holy grail" of diverse investment strategies by virtually doing nothing.

### 2020
* So far the company has seen much change. A quick review of the Quantopian Open Landing page will find that the contest is now gone. ([Quantopian Open Landing Page](https://www.quantopian.com/contest)) ([Retiring the Contest](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/retiring-the-contest)). Other competitors are still offering their contest and have a larger winnings like Quantiacs. While the post says that the contest has been successful John speaks on moving towards third party challenges. Reviewing one of the challenges, they are focused on solving specific company problems. Quantopian is still giving offerings to investors through competitions but skipping the step of giving a big prize funding on their end to be a hedge fund themselves. ([10K Third Party Challenge](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/$10k-third-party-challenge-design-a-factor-for-a-large-us-corporate-pension)) The firm is looking at other ways to diversify its income by allowing algorithms to be licensed out for specific things with said third party challenges. This would create a "crowd-sourcing on demand" type of effect. ([New Business Idea](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/12/17/crowdsourced-investment-tech-firm-to-let-outsiders.html])) This could be seen as a positive change but one has to wonder why would they need to shake things up if they were doing well? One would think to just add this as another challenge feature. 
* Another red flag was brought up earlier in this study as a note in the funding/investors section. As a refresher, in 2016 Steve Cohen put $250 Million into the firm to be under the direction of algorithms managed by Quantopian and in addition make an investment in Quantopian itself. In February of this year, 2020, Fawcett announced that investment money would be returned due to under performance. ([Steve Cohen Investment](https://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-cohen-quantopian/steve-cohen-bets-250-million-on-firm-that-uses-algorithms-idUSKCN1071XI))([Under Performance](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/02/20/fintech-firm-quantopian-is-returning-investors.html)) To see this returning of investment dollars in February and then a change in their challenge system in May, would have me very weary as an investor. There seems to be some trouble in paradise. Fawcett himself stated that the company would hit the reset button as a whole because their strategy has underperfomed. Bizjournal states that until then Quantopian had followed a market-neutral strategy. They wanted their members to make market-neutral based algorithms, one can then say it is not the algorithms fault, but the fault of Fawcett. Regardless this is not looking the best for the firm.
* Another changed/lost feature of Quantopian is the live trading. This has upset many users and is very odd to say the least, especially for a company with so many competitors. ([No Live Trading](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/live-trading-being-shutdown-my-response#:~:text=We%20have%20decided%20to%20stop,of%20trading%20through%20a%20broker.&text=Please%20reconsider%20a%20longer%20time,down%20the%20personal%20live%20trading.]))

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
  - Companies in this domain are focused on big returns from diverse outlets with little to no losses. As of late Quantopian has underperformed as seen above. Quantopian specifically has their criteria for their contest and to pick a winning algorithm on their website. ([Quantopian Open Rules](https://www.quantopian.com/contest/rules)) Now, with their challenges they are specific for each challenge but it all requires backtesting and being profitable. Quantopian Open information:


    In order to be eligible for participation in the Contest, entries are required to meet a particular set of criteria. When an entry is submitted to the Contest, the criteria are checked on a backtest starting 2 years prior to the date of submission, up to the most recent trading day. The criteria are then re-checked after each day that the entry remains active in the contest using a backtest starting from 2 years prior to the date of submission, through the end of the date being checked. If Participant’s entry fails one or more of the criteria on the initial test, or at any point after, it will be disqualified from the Contest. These are the criteria that are required of all Contest algorithms:
**Trade liquid stocks:** Trade liquid stocks: Contest entries must have 95% or more of their invested capital in stocks in the QTradableStocksUS universe (QTU, for short). This is checked at the end of each trading day by comparing an entry’s end-of-day holdings to the constituent members of the QTradableStocksUS on that day. Contest entries are allowed to have as little as 90% of their invested capital invested in members of the QTU on up to 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria. This is in place to help mitigate the effect of turnover in the QTU definition.

       **Low position concentration:** Contest entries cannot have more than 5% of their capital invested in any one asset. This is checked at the end of each trading day. Algorithms may exceed this limit and have up to 10% of their capital invested in a particular asset on up to 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria.

       **Long/short:** Contest entries must not have more than 10% net dollar exposure. This means that the long and short arms of a Contest entry can not be more than 10% different (measured as 10% of the total capital base). For example, if the entry has 100% of its capital invested, neither the sum value of the long investments nor the sum value of the short investments may exceed 55% of the total capital. This is measured at the end of each trading day. Entries may exceed this limit and have up to a 20% net dollar exposure on up to 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria.

      **Turnover:** Contest entries must have a mean daily turnover between 5%-65% measured over a 63-trading-day rolling window. Turnover is defined as amount of capital traded divided by the total portfolio value. For algorithms that trade once per day, Turnover ranges from 0-200% (200% means the algorithm completely moved its capital from one set of assets to another). Entries are allowed to have as little as 3% rolling mean daily turnover on up to 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria. In addition, entries are allowed to have as much as 80% rolling mean daily turnover on 2% of trading days in the same backtest.

      **Leverage:** Contest entries must maintain a gross leverage between 0.8x-1.1x. In other words entries must have between 80% and 110% of their capital invested in US equities. The leverage of an algorithm is checked at the end of each trading day. Entries are allowed to have as little as 70% of their capital invested (0.7x leverage) on up to 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria. In addition, entries are allowed to have as much as 120% of their capital invested (1.2x leverage) on up to 2% of trading days in the same backtest. These buffers are meant to provide leniency in cases where trades are canceled, fill prices drift, or other events that can cause leverage to change unexpectedly.

      **Low beta-to-SPY:** Contest entries must have an absolute beta-to-SPY below 0.3 (low correlation to the market). Beta-to-SPY is measured over a rolling 6-month regression length and is checked at the end of each trading day. The beta at the end of each day must be between -0.3 and 0.3. Contest entries can exceed this limit and have a beta-to-SPY of up to 0.4 on 2% of trading days in the backtest used to check criteria.

      **Low exposure to Quantopian risk model:** Contest entries must be less than 20% exposed to each of the 11 sectors defined in the Quantopian risk model. Contest entries must also be less than 40% exposed to each of the 5 style factors in the risk model. Exposure to risk factors in the Quantopian risk model is measured as the mean net exposure over a 63-trading-day rolling window at the end of each trading day. Contest entries can exceed these limits on up to 2% of trading days 2 from years before the entry was submitted to today. Entries are allow to have each of sector exposure as high as 25% on 2% of trading days. Additionally, each style exposure can go as high as 50% on 2% of trading days.

      **Positive returns:** Contest entries must have positive total returns. The return used for the Positive Returns constraint is defined as the portfolio value at the end of the backtest used to check criteria divided by the starting capital ($10M). As with all the criteria, the positive returns criterion is re-checked after each day that an entry remains active in the contest.
     **Submission**
      1. Every trading day, there is a submission deadline at 9:30am ET. Contest entries submitted before the 9:30am deadline will be entered into the Contest, and will be evaluated and scored after the current trading day. Entries submitted after the deadline will still be entered into the Contest, but will not be evaluated and scored until after the next trading day. For example, if an entry is submitted on Wednesday at 9:00am ET, it will be evaluated and scored at the end of the trading day on Wednesday (the result should be published on Thursday morning). If an entry is submitted on Wednesday at 11am ET, it will be evaluated and scored at the end of the trading day on Thursday (the result should be published on Friday morning).

      2. To submit an entry to the contest, the Participant must run a full backtest on their algorithm. Upon successful completion of the full backtest, the Participant must click the "Enter Contest" button, found in the development environment of their algorithm. Each night after the Participant submits his/her entry, Quantopian will run a backtest with the Participant's algorithm starting from 2 years before the entry was submitted up to the end of the most recent trading day (the current Contest date). The backtest will simulate deployment of $US 10 million. The backtest performance will be used to verify that the algorithm meets the required Contest criteria (see “Criteria” section above). Each night, the most recent backtest will also be used to score and rank the entry (see “Scoring & Ranking” section below). The top ranked Participants will be displayed on the leaderboard.

      3. If the nightly backtest fails to complete for any reason, the entry is disqualified. If this occurs we will attempt to contact the Participant via email. The Participant will also receive a message on the 'Pending/Withdrawn' section of their contest dashboard. The Participant may adjust the code and re-submit.

      4. If the nightly backtest fails to meet any of the required Contest criteria, the entry is disqualified. If this occurs, we will attempt to contact the Participant via email. The Participant will also receive a message on the 'Pending/Withdrawn' section of their contest dashboard.

      5. Submitted algorithms do not need to be re-submitted on a daily basis. Any submitted algorithm will run in the contest indefinitely, unless disqualified or manually withdrawn.

      6. If the contest backtest takes longer than 5 hours to complete, the entry is disqualified.

      7. Each Participant may submit up to 5 algorithms to the contest.

      8. Odds of winning depend on the total number of eligible entries.

      9. To remove an algorithm from the contest, Participants may navigate to the 'Active Entries' section of their contest dashboard and click the withdraw icon next to the entry that they wish to withdraw.

      10. Participant's entry must not violate or infringe on any applicable law or regulation or third-party rights.

      11. As always on Quantopian, Participant owns his/her algorithm. Participant's intellectual property will remain Participant's secret; we will not look at Participant's code with rare exceptions described in our Terms of Use and Privacy Statement.

      **Scoring and Ranking**
  Contest entries that meet all the structural criteria (see “Criteria” section above) are ranked after every trading day based on a scoring function. The score of an entry is based on its out-of-sample returns and trailing volatility. Entries are rewarded a high score for achieving high returns and low volatility.

      Each day after an entry has been submitted, the daily return of the entry is divided by the trailing 63-trading-day volatility to compute a volatility-adjusted daily return (VADR). The score of the entry is the sum of its VADRs since the entry was submitted to the Contest.

      The scoring function can be written like this:


      At the end of each day, participants are ranked based on their highest scoring active entry at the end of that day. The minimum score that an entry or participant can have is 0. The top 10 participants will be displayed on the leaderboard every day.
([Quantopian Open Rules](https://www.quantopian.com/contest/rules))

#### Key Takeaways
- Quantopian has made many big moves getting series C investing, getting support from big names like Steve Cohen, and shaking up the hedge fund space as a whole, but at the same time **they still need to figure things out.** Quantopian is going through much restructuring which leaves the question, how are things truly going at the firm? Quantopian **ended up giving its investment money back recently due to underperfomance.** There are **many other competitors** on the market. Quantopian truly **pushes its educational abilities,** but we will have to see if other incentives like larger cash offerings from competitors like Quantiacs along with **all these different changes** Quantopian is doing does not lead people away.


## Final Recommendations (Q&A)

*  Q: If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * A: Through my research I did find that a major thing that consumers liked about Quantiacs over Quantopian was the fact that they allowed them to keep their IP but license it to them and you keep 10% of lifetime profits. I would suggest giving a way larger percentage like even a 60/40. With Numerai, people like that you do not have to share your code with them. People understand the power of what they are doing and you do not want to look like you are treating people dirty. You do not want to show people you are taking their hard work. You want to allow people to keep all of their intellectual property and do some type of licensing system where they themselves are able to license their algorithms to companies. All you do is act as a third party platform that gives the relationship to connect these Quants to the banks/ investors and you get your commission/percentage for educating the Quants and creating that connection. The best thing is to keep the power in the eyes of the actual Quants. They should also keep the competition going because that keeps the consumers motivated. They should also offer even bigger prizes because that is all people talk about with Quantiacs. They would then do the same thing as the third parties with the winning algorithms and request a license of the winning algorithm from the creator. They could do something like hiring the Quant for their firm. They also need to offer everything, not just equities, and they need to go back to offering live trading. ([How do Numerai, QuantConnect, Quantiacs, & Quantopian compare](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/4yx8x1/how_do_numerai_quantconnect_quantiacs_and/))

* Q: Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - A: It is 2020, look at things like Walmart, Amazon, the one stop shop always wins. You want to get as close to monopolizing as you possibly can. Monopolize in the context of your company. You have to be a shark and eat everything. People want to be able to go to one site, learn, do their research, backtest, and then put it all live. That is the streamlined aspect I talked about in the very beginning. Things need to look pretty and be streamlined. People also want to believe in the company they are working with, they want to believe that it is a good company and they are not being scammed. This is where the licensing and transparency comes into play. Also, in the end all these views just came from looking at what people want. I have used a reddit here as a resource. You have to keep your ear to the streets. Companies spend so much time trying to reinvent the wheel when some simple internet sleuthing will help you find the little things that consumers are looking for. All this would definitely put them ahead of their competitors.   

* Q: What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  - A: I do not think that this would require any new technologies. The only thing that would require any work is connecting them with brokerages so they could do live trading again. They already had this previously so all they would have to do is start it back.


* Q: Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - A: This would be an appropriate solution because it just makes sense and it would also make everything easier for the consumer. The trader would be able to do all their learning and research, backtest with data, and then implement their algorithm all in one place. That would be perfect. You want the easiest experience for your customers. In the end, I  believe that this is an excellent idea and I myself am going to use the resource to learn, as an aspiring Quant, but on the hedge fund side of things Quantopian needs to get the bugs out.
